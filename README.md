# Loial

Loial is a builder and will help you build Python-compatible functions in other languages.

This project aims to allow fast prototyping of new solutions in Python and then convert the solution to another language in parts. This is useful to reuse unit tests and allows Python to provide glue code.
The alternative implementation will be ignored if not supported on the target platform, allowing the support of functionality across systems.
